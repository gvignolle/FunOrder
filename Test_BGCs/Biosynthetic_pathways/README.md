=========

We used a set of 10 empirically well characterized Protein sets of described Pathways from a broad range of different genera not present in our database **(see our publication for specific references)**. The sequences were downloaded from NCBI or UniProt database. All Preotein sets were manually inspected for correctness and completeness based on the respective literature.
