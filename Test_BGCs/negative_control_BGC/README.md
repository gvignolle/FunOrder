FunOrder
=========

The set of negative controls - 60 random BGCs which were created by subsampling randomly the fungal proteome database with a Perl script from the MEME suit. For each random BGC a different -seed number was given to guarantee non repetitive BGCs, each random BGC contained 3-10 randomly chosen protein sequences in a random order.
