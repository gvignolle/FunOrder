FunOrder
=========

The set of negative controls - 60 random GCs which were created by subsampling randomly the fungal proteome database with a Perl script from the MEME suit. For each random GC a different -seed number was given to guarantee non repetitive GCs, each random GC contained 3-10 randomly chosen protein sequences in a random order.
