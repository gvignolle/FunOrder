=========

We used a set of 30 empirically well characterized BGCs from a broad range of different genera as positive controls **(see our publication for specific references)**. The sequences were downloaded from NCBI or the MIBiG (Minimum information about a biosynthetic gene cluster) database. All BGCs were manually inspected for correctness and completeness based on the respective literature.
