=========

We used a set of 30 empirically well characterized BGCs from a broad range of different genera as positive controls **(see our publication for specific references)**. To 24 of these (marked as plus_) we added when possible 4 genes outside of the defined BGC (Two on both sides 5' and 3'). The sequences were downloaded from NCBI or the MIBiG (Minimum information about a biosynthetic gene cluster) database. All BGCs were manually inspected for correctness and completeness based on the respective literature.
